# Flux Machines Development Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As contributors and maintainers of the *Flux Machines* project, we pledge to foster a collaborative, respectful, and purpose-driven environment for development. We are committed to creating a mod that is well-crafted, cohesive, and valuable to the Minecraft community.

## Our Standards

The following standards help us maintain a high-quality project and respectful collaboration:

### General Conduct
- **Respectful Communication**: Engage respectfully with other contributors, and be considerate of differing opinions.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Offer feedback thoughtfully and accept constructive input with an open mind.
- **Inclusiveness**: Value each contributor’s ideas, skills, and experience, regardless of background or expertise.

### Development Conduct
- **Feature Purpose**: Ensure that all proposed features, items, blocks, or mechanics contribute to the core experience of *Flux Machines*. Features should be added with purpose and be relevant to the mod’s goals, not simply added for novelty.
- **Compatibility with Other Mods**: *Flux Machines* currently only supports compatibility with [The One Probe](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-one-probe) and [Just Enough Items (JEI)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei). Any additional mod compatibilities should be created as separate add-ons or packages rather than integrated into the main mod.
- **Clear Documentation**: Document all new features thoroughly, including code comments and external documentation, to help maintain a clean and understandable codebase.

### Branching and Packages
- **Modular Compatibilities**: Keep compatibility features with other mods modular. Compatibilities should not interfere with the main codebase, ensuring Flux Machines remains versatile and independent.
- **Purpose-Driven Contributions**: Avoid adding features without reason. New elements should enhance gameplay or contribute to the mod's technical capabilities, solving a problem or addressing a user need within the mod’s intended scope.

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct and ensuring all contributions align with the purpose of *Flux Machines*. They may reject or request changes to any pull requests that do not follow these standards.

## Enforcement

Instances of inappropriate or purpose-divergent contributions may be discussed with the contributor. This Code of Conduct applies to all development spaces, including GitHub discussions, code reviews, and other project-related interactions.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted with consideration for *Flux Machines* and its development standards.
